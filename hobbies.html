        <p>My main interest is learning languages. That is why I can speak six languages, and now I try to learn german, but due to my studying at university and my job sometimes I have no time to do it.</p>
        <p>Today I am able to speak English, Russian, Kazakh (it is obviously, because I live in Kazakhstan). In addition I can keep conversation going in French (due to my level is C1), also in Turkish, Ukranian (I am almost fluent in these languages because my ex-classmate is from Poltava and I visit Turkey, watch movies in Turkish very often), and of course Italian, because it is simple to learn.</p>
        <p>I am involved in learning languages since childhood. I am not aware how I am polyglot if my parents are not.</p>
        <p>Due to my big passion on linguistics, I work as a teacher of English and Kazakh. I teach little children: not only does it bring money to me, but also I obtain knowledge of communication with people and how to be independent. It is a really useful skill, because I live far from my hometown. (Actually I do not have a scholarship, that is why I need money and communication skills to survive in Nur-Sultan).</p>
        <p>I am a big patriot of Kazakhstan despite the situation here. I do love our culture and I had been dreaming about becoming an ambassador of Kazakhstan before entering to Astana IT University to learn foreign mentalities and traditions, and to demonstrate my own as well. However, after applying to IT University, I realized that I can present my country's interests via IT Projects. But I need to work hard to do it:) For example: learn programming languages except Foreign grammar and vocabulary.</p>
